    <h2>Spreading Thankfulness in Open Source&trade;</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>SayThanks.io</strong> provides a handy URL for you to share
        with your open source projects&mdash; it encourages users to send a simple thank you note to you, the creator of that project.

    <p>
        This simple link can be addded to READMEs and project documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, you can enjoy a nice inbox of very small but thoughtful messages
        from the happy users of the software that you've toiled over. :)
